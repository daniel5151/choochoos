## Building

The default target is updated according the the most-recent assignment, so building is as straightforward as running:

```bash
make
```

Additional debug statements can be enabled by invoking `make DEBUG=1`.

## Documentation

Documentation for each assignment can be found under the [docs](./docs/) folder. Each assignment has it's own directory with associated documentation.

e.g: for assignment K1, the documentation is under [docs/k1](./docs/k1/).
