# The `choochoos` Kernel

Written by Daniel Prilik (dprilik - 20604934) and James Hageman (jdhagema - 20604974).

## Project Structure

### Navigating the Repo

`choochoos` follows a fairly standard C/C++ project structure, whereby all header files are placed under the `include` directory, with corresponding implementation files placed under the `src` directory.

At the moment, both the `choochoos` kernel and userspace live under the same `include` and `src` directory, though we plan to separate kernel-specific files and userspace-specific files at some point.

### Building `choochoos`

For details on building the project, see the `README.md` file at the root of this repository.
